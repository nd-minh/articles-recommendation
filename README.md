# Article Recommendations on IBM Watson Studio

In this project, we will investigate the interactions that users have with articles on IBM Watson Studio platform and then provide recommendations of articles that users may like. We will use a series of different recommending techniques that we think will fit different groups of users. 

For **new users**, we use rank-based recommendation to provide them with the most popular articles on the platform. 

For **existing users**, we provide them with articles that their most similar colleagues like and mostly interact with. We also presente a matrix factorization-based recommendation system that can be deployed online to provide recommendation for existing users. 

Using our models from this project, we can increase user interaction with IBM Watson Studio platform. Our models can also be easily transferred to similar platform such as online forums.
